The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who wrote about the great pestilence in 1893?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e4", "answers": [{"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": "Francis Aidan Gasquet", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Gasquet think the plague was?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e5", "answers": [{"text": "some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "bubonic plague", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague", "answer_start": 138}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the second edition of Gasquet's book come out?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e6", "answers": [{"text": "1908", "answer_start": 281}, {"text": "1908", "answer_start": 281}, {"text": "1908", "answer_start": 281}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Gasquet's book blame the plague on?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e7", "answers": [{"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 299}, {"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 299}, {"text": "rats and fleas", "answer_start": 299}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another plague thought to have spread the same way?", "id": "57264cc6dd62a815002e80e8", "answers": [{"text": "the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE.", "answer_start": 423}, {"text": "Justinian plague", "answer_start": 427}, {"text": "Justinian plague", "answer_start": 427}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1893", "answer_start": 74}], "question": "When was Francis Aidan Gasquet born?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1893", "answer_start": 74}], "question": "When did the bubonic plague begin in Europe?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Black Death", "answer_start": 243}], "question": "What was the Justinian plague epidemic called?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d246f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "700 CE", "answer_start": 503}], "question": "In what year was the Eastern Roman Empire established?", "id": "5a2ec82fa83784001a7d2470", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\".

Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations. In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K.

Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished.

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.

It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what year did the Amazon experience a drought that may have been more extreme than in 2005?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa76f", "answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "2010", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "2010", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many square miles large was the region impacted by the 2010 drought?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa770", "answers": [{"text": "1,160,000", "answer_start": 151}, {"text": "1,160,000", "answer_start": 151}, {"text": "1,160,000", "answer_start": 151}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many areas were impacted by the the death of vegetation in the 2010 drought?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa771", "answers": [{"text": "three epicenters", "answer_start": 284}, {"text": "three epicenters", "answer_start": 284}, {"text": "three", "answer_start": 284}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The southern part of the Amazon forest was mainly impacted by drought in what year?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa772", "answers": [{"text": "2005", "answer_start": 339}, {"text": "2005", "answer_start": 339}, {"text": "2005", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many tons of carbon are absorbed the Amazon in a typical year?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa773", "answers": [{"text": "1.5 gigatons", "answer_start": 483}, {"text": "1.5 gigatons", "answer_start": 483}, {"text": "1.5 gigatons", "answer_start": 483}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "Amazon rain forest experienced another mild drought in what year", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1.5 gigatons", "answer_start": 483}], "question": "The Amazon releases how much carbon dioxide each year?", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "epicenters", "answer_start": 290}], "question": "The 2010 drought had three what were vegetation increased?", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "5 gigatons", "answer_start": 535}], "question": "In 2005 the force absorbed how much carbon dioxide?", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "carbon dioxide", "answer_start": 499}], "question": "In 2010 the force absorbed 8 Gt of what", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Imperialism is confused with what other term?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d", "answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e", "answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f", "answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "commercial", "answer_start": 490}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70", "answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71", "answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}], "question": "Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}], "question": " What does colonialism and imperialism share?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686629", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}], "question": "Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}], "question": "Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54c", "answers": [{"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism often means a country doing what?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54d", "answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "a conquest over an area", "answer_start": 700}, {"text": "the process of a country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 322}, {"text": "dominating areas", "answer_start": 536}, {"text": "country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54e", "answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "by conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1058}, {"text": "political and monetary dominance", "answer_start": 409}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what do conquering people pass down to native populations?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54f", "answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "the characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1399}, {"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is colonialism's core meaning?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c550", "answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 845}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 231}], "question": "Political disadvantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}], "question": " Colonialism never means a country doing what?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}], "question": " How would one create an empire by means of non-Imperialism?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "question": " what do conquering people take away from native populations?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}], "question": " What is colonialism's antithesis?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the most controversial aspect of imperialism?", "id": "5730876a396df9190009617a", "answers": [{"text": "empire-building", "answer_start": 74}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building", "answer_start": 45}, {"text": "is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds", "answer_start": 38}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds", "answer_start": 45}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building", "answer_start": 45}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " J.

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power."}, {"qas": [{"question": "some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600", "answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c601", "answers": [{"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "World War I", "answer_start": 368}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602", "answers": [{"text": "the 1950s", "answer_start": 616}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c603", "answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did Hobson argue to rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c604", "answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "domestic social reforms", "answer_start": 646}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation.", "answer_start": 725}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "question": "There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "question": " When weren't Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "question": " When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "question": " Hobson argued that imperialism wasn't an international what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d91", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}], "question": " How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.

In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fa\u00e7ade.

They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a \"racket\" by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.

Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as \"internal colonialism\". Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's \"internal colonialism\". However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans.

The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did the loss mean to France?", "id": "57340d124776f419006617bf", "answers": [{"text": "disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession", "answer_start": 88}, {"text": "disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion", "answer_start": 88}, {"text": "elimination of French power", "answer_start": 33}, {"text": ".", "answer_start": 985}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What made Ohio Country vulnerable?", "id": "57340d124776f419006617c0", "answers": [{"text": "military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes", "answer_start": 304}, {"text": "construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes", "answer_start": 288}, {"text": "the construction of military roads to the area", "answer_start": 284}, {"text": "military roads to the area", "answer_start": 304}, {"text": "the construction of military roads", "answer_start": 284}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory complete?", "id": "57340d124776f419006617c1", "answers": [{"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What natives were displaced by British takeover in Florida?", "id": "57340d124776f419006617c2", "answers": [{"text": "Choctaw and the Creek", "answer_start": 646}, {"text": "tribes that did not want to do business with the British", "answer_start": 553}, {"text": "Choctaw and the Creek", "answer_start": 646}, {"text": "Choctaw and the Creek", "answer_start": 646}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did many Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?", "id": "57340d124776f419006617c3", "answers": [{"text": "Most went to Cuba,", "answer_start": 831}, {"text": "Most went to Cuba", "answer_start": 831}, {"text": "Cuba", "answer_start": 844}, {"text": "Cuba", "answer_start": 844}, {"text": "Cuba", "answer_start": 844}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Most went to Cuba", "answer_start": 831}], "question": "Where did no Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?", "id": "5ad3bd87604f3c001a3fef23", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes", "answer_start": 304}], "question": "What made Ohio Country safe?", "id": "5ad3bd87604f3c001a3fef24", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1769", "answer_start": 443}], "question": "When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory incomplete?", "id": "5ad3bd87604f3c001a3fef25", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Choctaw and the Creek", "answer_start": 646}], "question": "What natives were displaced by British takeover in Georgia?", "id": "5ad3bd87604f3c001a3fef26", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession", "answer_start": 88}], "question": "What did the win mean to France?", "id": "5ad3bd87604f3c001a3fef27", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "For many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession. The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes. Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico."}]}]}
